# ECE720 MLOps Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the ECE720 Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) course. The project focuses on implementing a complete MLOps pipeline for a machine learning model, demonstrating best practices in model development, deployment, and monitoring. The goal is to create a production-ready ML system that integrates robust data processing, model training, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and monitoring.

## Features
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data ingestion, cleaning, and preprocessing using Python and relevant libraries.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of a machine learning model (e.g., classification/regression) with hyperparameter tuning.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and production environments.
- **Monitoring**: Integration of logging and performance monitoring for the deployed model.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Git
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandstorm12/ece720_mlops_finalproject.git
   cd ece720_mlops_finalproject
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ece720_mlops .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 ece720_mlops
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Run the data processing scripts to prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python src/data_processing/preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**:
   Train the model using the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/training/train.py
   ```

3. **Model Deployment**:
   Deploy the model using the deployment script or Docker container:
   ```bash
   python src/deployment/deploy.py
   ```

4. **Monitoring**:
   Monitor the deployed model using the monitoring utilities:
   ```bash
   python src/monitoring/monitor.py
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline
The repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline includes:
- Linting and code formatting checks
- Running unit and integration tests
- Building and pushing Docker images
- Deploying the model to a cloud service (if configured)

To trigger the pipeline, push changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request.

## Testing
Run the test suite using:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
